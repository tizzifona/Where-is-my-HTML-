# **Where is my HTML?**  

### ✅Project Explanation
Our UX designer has given us the UI design for an important part of our website: the login page. We’re going to structure only the HTML code. Don’t do any CSS.

### ✅What are we going to do?  
We’re going to create the HTML structure of a login form following a provided UI design.

### ✅Where are we going to do it? 
We’ll work in an HTML file saved inside a specific folder.

### ✅How are we going to do it? 
We’ll use HTML5 semantic tags to structure the content, paying attention to how the “boxes” or elements are organized so that another developer can later add CSS styles.

### ✅With what will we do it?  
We’ll use HTML5 and a text editor like Visual Studio Code. CSS is not allowed—only HTML.

### ✅How will our work be evaluated? 
The project will be evaluated based on the structure and semantics of the HTML, as well as the clear and logical organization of the page elements.

### ✅Step-by-Step

Step 1: Create the Project Folder 
- Create a folder named `donde-esta-mi-html` on your computer where you’ll store all project files.

Step 2: Create the HTML File  
- Inside the `donde-esta-mi-html` folder, create a file named `index.html`.

Step 3: Structure the Content in the HTML File

1. **Start the HTML file** with the basic structure of an HTML5 document.  
2. **Create the main container** (`<div>` or a more semantic tag) that will serve as the main "box" for the form.  
3. **Create the form** (`<form>`) inside the main container to hold input fields and buttons.  
4. **Add the social login buttons** inside the form using `<button>` and `<img>` tags.  
5. **Add a separation line** (`<p><span>or</span></p>`) between social login and manual data entry.  
6. **Create the section for login with email and password** (`<div>`) with input fields for email and password using `<input>` tags.  
7. **Add a submit button** (`<button>Log In</button>`) and a link for password recovery (`<a href="#">Forgot password?</a>`).  
8. **Close the form and the HTML structure**

Step 4: Save and Review
- Save all changes in the `index.html` file and review to ensure the HTML is correctly structured according to the given instructions.
